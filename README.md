- Make better UI to go back from SeasonDetailsTable
- Signal to user they can click the seasonWinner (button with color?)
- Global search for console.log -> remove
- Make component out of SeasonTable
- Implement switching between DataTable, SeasonTable and SeasonDetails using react router - needs further exploration
